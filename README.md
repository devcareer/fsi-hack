# Finally, a project set to change the face of financial transactions in Nigeria and Africa at large!

It offers inclusive, simple, seamless, stress-free, almost fraud-free transactions for Nigeria (the reality, there is no perfection to this; albeit, very close). To drastically reduce fraud (Building on existing, already accepted (by customers) platforms), transactions will be verified to ensure they are genuinely made by authorised users using a higher level of verification/authentication to banking processes. Via a trained model, unusual transaction patterns will be flagged as fraud and a two-factor authentication 1(2FA) will be required. In comparison and contrast to the existing OTP method, no new method will be introduced; as well, mobile phones ,including future phones(to ensure inclusion for the formal and informal sectors) will be able to automatically detect codes sent to them via SMS and authenticate such transactions (by comparing with that already encrypted on the server).

For cases detected as fraud; every user/customer will be uniquely identified and will be able to block transactions with this unique identifier anytime, anywhere of which reactivation can only be done by the genuine user at any of their bank's branches.
